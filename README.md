# pureFunctionalAlgorithms

This project contains some common-used functions and algorithms, written in Scala pure-functional style.

Current list of supported algorithms:

# Chars operations:
1) Check, whether the char is vowel
2) Check, whether the char is consonant

# List/values operations:
1) Functional getting the Nth element in a List
2) Checking the List/value, whether it is a palindrome
3) Counter for the number of sign changes in a list of integers
4) Counter for the number of letter changes from vowel to consonant in a list of integers

# Encoders:
1) RLE 

# Decoders: 
1) RLE

Planned:
1) Huffman encoder/decoder
2) Operations with chars
3) Operations with integers
