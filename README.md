# pureFunctionalAlgorithms

This project contains some common-used functions and algorithms, written in Scala pure-functional style.

Current list of supported algorithms:

# List/values operation:
1) Custom getting the Nth element in a List
2) Checking the List/value, whether it is a palindrome
3) Counter for the number of sign changes in a list of integers


# Encoders:
1) RLE 

# Decoders: 
1) RLE

Planned:
1) Huffman encoder/decoder
2) Counter for the number of letter changes from vowel to consonant in a list of integers
